trello-cli --get-all-cards <board-id>

trello-cli --create-card <list-id> "<card-name>"

# Card with description

# Card with due date (ISO format)
trello-cli --create-card <list-id> "<card-name>" --due "2025-01-15"

# Full card
trello-cli --create-card <list-id> "<card-name>" --desc "<description>" --due "2025-01-15"
```

trello-cli --update-card <card-id> --name "<new-name>"

# Update description only
trello-cli --update-card <card-id> --desc "<new-description>"

# Update due date only

### Attachment Operations

**Note:** Downloading attachments is not supported. Trello's download API requires browser session authentication, not API tokens. Use `--attach-url` to link attachments between cards instead.

# Returns: {"ok":true,"data":[{"id":"...","name":"file.pdf","url":"...","bytes":12345,"mimeType":"application/pdf","date":"...","isUpload":true}]}
```

# Upload a local file
trello-cli --upload-attachment <card-id> "/path/to/file.pdf"

# Upload with custom name
trello-cli --upload-attachment <card-id> "/path/to/file.pdf" --name "Project Spec"
# Returns: {"ok":true,"data":{"id":"...","name":"Project Spec","url":"...","bytes":12345,"mimeType":"application/pdf"}}
```

# Attach URL with custom name
trello-cli --attach-url <card-id> "https://example.com/document.pdf" --name "External Doc"

## Common Workflows

### 1. First Time Setup

```bash
# Get API key from: https://trello.com/power-ups/admin
# Get Token by visiting (replace YOUR_API_KEY):
# https://trello.com/1/authorize?expiration=never&scope=read,write&response_type=token&name=TrelloCLI&key=YOUR_API_KEY

trello-cli --set-auth <your-api-key> <your-token>
trello-cli --check-auth  # Verify it works
```

### 2. Explore Board Structure

```bash
trello-cli --get-boards                    # Find your board
trello-cli --get-lists <board-id>          # See all lists
trello-cli --get-all-cards <board-id>      # See all cards
```

### 3. Create Task with Full Details

```bash
# Step 1: Find the target list
trello-cli --get-lists <board-id>

# Step 2: Create the card
trello-cli --create-card <list-id> "Implement login feature" \
  --desc "Add OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub providers" \
  --due "2025-01-20"
```

### 4. Move Card Through Workflow

```bash
# Get list IDs
trello-cli --get-lists <board-id>
# Example output shows: To Do (id1), In Progress (id2), Done (id3)

# Move from To Do to In Progress
trello-cli --move-card <card-id> <in-progress-list-id>

# Later, move to Done
trello-cli --move-card <card-id> <done-list-id>
```

### 5. Update Existing Card

```bash
# Get card details first
trello-cli --get-card <card-id>

# Update what you need
trello-cli --update-card <card-id> --desc "Updated requirements: ..."
```

### 6. Work with Attachments

```bash
# List attachments on a card
trello-cli --list-attachments <card-id>

# Upload a file to a card
trello-cli --upload-attachment <card-id> "./document.pdf" --name "Project Spec"

# Attach a URL (also used to link attachments between cards)
trello-cli --attach-url <card-id> "https://docs.google.com/..." --name "Design Doc"

# Delete an attachment
trello-cli --delete-attachment <card-id> <attachment-id>
```

Note: To copy an attachment between cards, use `--list-attachments` on the source card to get the URL, then `--attach-url` on the target card.

## Tips

1. **Use `--get-all-cards`** instead of multiple `--get-cards` calls
2. **Cache board and list IDs** - they don't change often
3. **ISO date format** for due dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`
4. **Quote strings with spaces** in card names and descriptions
5. **Check `ok` field** in response before processing data
